		<h3 id="MySQLQueue">MySQL Queue for Background Worker Threads <a href="#MySQLQueue" class="anchorlink">&para;</a></h3>
		
		<p>The SQL statements below create a queue (FIFO) of tasks, stored in the database.
		These tasks are executed by a series of threads, which are launched and monitored
		by a parent process. If a thread dies unexpectedly, the records being processed by
		that thread are reset so another thread can process them.</p>
		
		<p>The <code>INSERT...SELECT</code> statement below inserts a new record in the queue.
		It's <code>position</code> column must be +1 of the largest current position,
		which is achieved with a <code>SELECT</code>. The <code>COALESCE()</code>
		function handles the case where there is no current records for the groupid.</p>
		
<pre class="brush:sql">
INSERT INTO queue (groupid, position, status, type, data, created, modified)
SELECT '9aa6df9c-c496-11e0-a99c-0b6bfba855b4',
       COALESCE(MAX(q.position), -1) + 1 as position,
       'waiting', 'page', 'somedata', NOW(), NOW()
FROM queue q WHERE q.groupid = '9aa6df9c-c496-11e0-a99c-0b6bfba855b4'
ORDER BY position DESC
LIMIT 1
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE groupid = groupid
</pre>

        <p>The <code>UPDATE</code> statement below sets the background thread's ID
        to the first record in the queue, determined by the <code>position</code> column.
        The thread then retrieves all records matching it's thread ID and processes them.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
UPDATE queue
SET status = 'running', threadnum = 1
WHERE groupid = '9aa6df9c-c496-11e0-a99c-0b6bfba855b4' AND status = 'waiting'
ORDER BY position
LIMIT 1
</pre>
		
		<p>Note: The queries above can occasionally encounter deadlocks.
		To handle this, the PHP script retries the query after waiting a random
		number of milliseconds. Since a limited number of background threads are
		executing the queries, the number of deadlocks are minimal.</p>

        <h3 id="BetterJDReports">Better JD Reports <a href="#BetterJDReports" class="anchorlink">&para;</a></h3>
        
        <p>The statements below are generated dynamically by the <a href="php.html#BetterJDReports">Better JD Reports</a>
        PHP application, and are shown here for example purposes.</p>
        
        <p>The <code>SELECT</code> statement below is from the &quot;File Search&quot; tab
        (see: <a href="images/php/betterjdreports-5.jpg">screenshot</a>). The application requires users to first
        enter the client ID and either the beginning of the file's path or the file's size (greater/less/equal/notequal).
        This assures that the executed query properly uses indexes to avoid long execution time.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
SELECT i.* FROM items i
WHERE concat(i.path1, i.path2, i.path3) LIKE '%default%'
    AND i.size2 &gt; 1024
    AND i.clientid = 'web1'
    AND i.path1 LIKE '/var/www/mainsite%'
    AND i.clientid = 'web1'
ORDER BY logorder asc, path1 asc, path2 asc, path3 asc
</pre>

    <p>The <code>SELECT</code> statement below is from the &quot;Latest Reports&quot; tab
        (see: <a href="images/php/betterjdreports-2.jpg">screenshot</a>). It starts by 
        using a subquery to retrieve the latest report records grouped by clientid and job.
        That query is wrapped by a <code>SELECT</code> that retrieves the record for those reports.
        This must be done as a subquery in order to retrieve the correct report's data.</p>
    
<pre class="brush:sql">
SELECT r.* 
FROM (
        SELECT r.clientid, r.job, MAX(r.reporttime) AS reporttime
        FROM reports r
            JOIN clients c ON r.clientid = c.clientid
            JOIN client_access ca ON ca.clientid = c.clientid AND ca.userid = 'amekkawi'
        WHERE r.job != '*' GROUP BY r.clientid, r.job
    ) AS ri
    JOIN reports r ON ri.clientid = r.clientid AND ri.job = r.job AND ri.reporttime = r.reporttime
ORDER BY reporttime DESC, clientid ASC, job ASC
</pre>

    <p>The next three <code>SELECT</code> statements are from the &quot;Clients&quot; tab
        (see: <a href="images/php/betterjdreports-3.jpg">screenshot</a>). To minimize the number
        of queries it is broken down into four steps. Using this method allows any number of
        client records to be displayed with only three queries.</p>
        
    <p>Step 1: Retrieve the list of client IDs, as well as the total number of reports for that client.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
SELECT count(r.clientid) AS totalreports, c.*
FROM (clients c)
    LEFT JOIN reports r ON c.clientid = r.clientid
    JOIN client_access ca on ca.clientid = c.clientid AND ca.userid = 'amekkawi'
GROUP BY c.clientid
ORDER BY clientid ASC, clientid ASC
</pre>

    <p>Step 2: The list of client IDs are used to generate a second query to retrieve the tags assigned to the clientid.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
SELECT * FROM tags
WHERE
    clientid = 'andre-macbookpro' OR clientid = 'andre-macmini'
    OR clientid = 'test' OR clientid = 'web1'
ORDER BY clientid
</pre>

    <p>Step 3: The list of client IDs are used again to generate a third query to retrieve the number of reports grouped by job.</p>

<pre class="brush:sql">
SELECT count(*) AS jobcount, clientid, job FROM reports
WHERE
    clientid = 'andre-macbookpro' OR clientid = 'andre-macmini'
    OR clientid = 'test' OR clientid = 'web1'
GROUP BY clientid, job
ORDER BY clientid, job
</pre>

    <p>Step 4: The records from step 2 and 3 are added to their respective clientid records from step 1.</p>
