		<h3>Simple MVC <a href="#SimpleMVC" class="anchorlink">&para;</a></h3>
		
		<p>In late 2010 I reviewed various PHP MVC frameworks for use with future projects.
			After reviewing several I decided to experiment with creating a simple MVC while simultaneously digging into the source of several popular frameworks.
			I ended development of this framework in early 2011 after deciding to use <a href="http://www.yiiframework.com/" target="_blank">Yii</a>.</p>

				These methods may also be overridden  by a <code>DBCore</code> class
				(e.g. <a href="https://github.com/amekkawi/simplemvc/blob/master/core/models/mysql/db_core.php" target="_blank">core/models/mysql/db_core.php</a>)

		<h3>Disk Usage Reports <a href="#DiskUsageReports" class="anchorlink">&para;</a></h3>
		
		<p>In early 2011 I began work on a tool that would allow a server administrator to direct users to user friendly, web based, disk usage reports. This was a tool I sorely needed while managing the university-wide web hosting at Howard University. The only solution I was able to find was durep, which did not meet many of my needs.</p>

		<h4>Feature Highlights</h4>
		
		<ul class="indent padded">
			<li>File scanning and report generation are separated so that the heavier work can be completed on another server.</li>
			<li>Includes three versions of the file scanning script. An EXE for Windows systems (which allows for full UTF-8 support), a linux bash script and a PHP version.</li>
			<li>Reports are saved as static JSON files and viewed by a static HTML page that uses jQuery to retrieve and display the data.</li>
			<li>JSON files are separated by directory so that large reports can be quickly viewed on slow connections.</li>
			<li>Errors encountered during scanning and report generation are displayed in the report for easy troubleshooting.</li>
			<li>Supports UTF-8.</li>
			
			<li>File names are based on a hash of the relative path to the root directory of the report.
				This will allow for future versions of Disk Usage Reports to compare reports generated at different times.</li>
				
			<li>Saves a file containing a list of basic directory data for the entire report, allowing the UI to display a sortable directory tree.
				This file is disabled once it passes a user-customizable byte threshold.</li>
				
			<li>Calculates the following for each directory, up to a user-customizable depth of sub-directories.
				<ul>
					<li>Top 100 largest files.</li>
					<li>Distribution of "last modified" dates, grouped by customizable time frames (e.g. 1-2 years).</li>
					<li>File size distribution, grouped by customizable size ranges (e.g. 500 KB - 1 MB).</li>
					<li>Totals by file type (e.g. .txt).</li>

		<h3>Better JD Reports <a href="#BetterJDReports" class="anchorlink">&para;</a></h3>
		
		<p>I use JungleDisk for backing up many of my desktops and several servers. While an excellent backup service it lacked a comprehensive way
			to monitor backups and review large backup reports. As part of the <a href="#SimpleMVC">Simple MVC</a> experiment, this project aimed to provide these features.</p>

		<h4>Feature Highlights</h4>

			<li>Report files are encrypted and compressed by clients before they are uploaded to the server running this application.</li>

			<li>Clients can be tagged for organization.</li>
			<li>The report search tab doubles as the report-purging interface, providing comprehensive search filters and a preview of what will be purged.</li>

		<h3>VTCalendar <a href="#VTCalendar" class="anchorlink">&para;</a></h3>
		
		<p>Originally made by Virginia Tech, this online calendar system was implemented at Howard University around 2007. At the time most calendar systems on the market seemed to be designed for commercial settings. These typically do not fit well with how a university organizes itself and manages its events. Since a university designed VTCalendar, it did not have these issues. After its implementation at Howard University I began work on improving the calendar, adding new features and fixes many bugs. In late 2008 I took over the project to share my changes with other universities.</p>

		<h4>Improvement Highlights</h4>
		
		<ul class="indent padded">
			<li>Major code refactoring.</li>
			<li>Hundreds of bug fixes and security fixes.</li>
			<li>Added "Upcoming" tab that shows all un-expired events in the next 365 days.</li>
			<li>Moved most styling from HTML (font tags, nested tables, etc) to CSS.</li>
			<li>Greatly improved ability to customize the calendar's look and feel.</li>
			<li>In additional to LDAP, an internal mechanism was added to authenticate users via HTTP authentication against a web address, to allow a custom script to provide authentication.</li>
			<li>Upcoming events can be displayed on other Web sites by inserting one line of JavaScript into the site. See <a href="http://www.howard.edu/calendar/public-export/instructions.php" target="_blank">www.howard.edu/calendar/public-export/instructions.php</a> for an example.</li>
			<li>Added a wizard that upgrades the database as necessary between versions.</li>
			<li>Better support for PostgreSQL.</li>
			<li>Added general polish, such as...
				<ul>
					<li>Performance and bandwidth improvements.</li>
					<li>Friendly messages for internal errors.</li>
					<li>Improved admin screens.</li>
					<li>Converted most DB columns to more appropriate types (i.e. 'text' to varchar).</li>
					<li>New color scheme.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Code Highlights</h4>
		
		<p>Most of VTCalendar's code is a mix of the previous authors and changes I have made. However, there are a few files that I created entirely:</p>
		
		<dl class="indent padded">
			
			<dt><a href="https://github.com/amekkawi/vtcalendar/blob/2.3.1/install/upgradedb.php" target="_blank">install/upgradedb.php</a> and <a href="https://github.com/amekkawi/vtcalendar/blob/2.3.1/install/upgradedb-functions.php" target="_blank">install/upgradedb-functions.php</a></dt>
			<dd>The database segment of the installation script. These scripts either create the database if it does not exist, or they modify the tables to match the schema defined in <a href="https://github.com/amekkawi/vtcalendar/blob/2.3.1/install/upgradedb-data.php" target="_blank">install/upgradedb-data.php</a>. Warnings are given before making changes that would destroy existing data (such as reducing the length of a varchar column).</dd>
